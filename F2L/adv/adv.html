                <p>A 2x2x1 block is constructed on the top layers. This can be done by connecting one edge with the top centre, followed by the solving of a corner-edge pair. The edge can usually be connected such that we get an easy corner-edge pair case.</p>

                <p>The final corner edge pair is solved, typically intuitively. However, this can also be broken down into 20 cases. This is less than the typical CFOP last slot since EO is already done. The algorithms for each case can be found in the F2L algorithms section.</p>

                <h3>OLS</h3>
                <p>The last pair is solved while orienting the top layer corners. This can usually be done by winter variation, summer variation, or some other 2-gen set. This is however only suitable if an EPLL skip is certain, or if the OLS case is extremely easy.</p>

                <p>The solve needs to be finished using one of four O-2GLL cases, or edge PLLs. These are generally much quicker to recognise and execute, and one in twelve times this step gives a skip is OLS is done at random.</p>

                <h3>EO-CP-2x2x3</h3>
                <p>This is where one is expected to end up after successfully doing the first three steps. With the R and U layers remaining, edges oriented and corners permuted, the rest of the cube can be solved using only R and U moves.</p>

                <h3>First Square</h3>
                <p>A 2x2x1 block is constructed on one of the two layers. This can be done by connecting one edge with the right centre, followed by the solving of a corner-edge pair. The edge can usually be connected such that we get an easy corner-edge pair case.</p>

                <h3>Second Square</h3>
                <p>Another 2x2x1 block is constructed on another layer using similar techniques. This may be worth it when the second square is already formed or one move from being formed, and the corner-edge pair continuation of the first square is not great.</p>

                <h3>Finish</h3>
                <p>The final few pieces are solved using a subset of the tripod or the snake algorithm set. The recognition of this set can be tricky and thus this route is worth it only in extreme cases. Most algortihms however are quite efficient and fast.</p>

            <p>Most of these methods are likely not substantially better than simple square > F2L > 2GLL; however a sensibly chosen combination of the above techniques across (or even within) solves on a case-by-case basis can provide a substantial boost of efficiency. The major benefit of having a CP-first approach rather than simply doing right block followed by ZBLL (other than a much lower algorithm count and faster recognition of course), is the extreme amounts of freedom one has in the 2-gen finish; applying many of the above techniques may even be impractical in the latter style of solving. Appropriate use of this freedom can lead to great solves.</p>
            <p>That said, it is important to note that we already know that the entire upcoming solve is going to be 2-gen, thus keeping it clean and simple while giving TPS the priority will be key in most solves.</p>
